# Methods
- Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods test() and exec() and with the String methods match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split().


# test()
- The test() method compares the target text with the regex pattern and returns a boolean value accordingly.
- If there is a match it returns true otherwise false.

# exec()
- The exec() method compares the target text with the regex pattern. If there's a match, it returns an array with the match â€“ otherwise it returns null.

# match()
- The match() method of String values retrieves the result of matching this string against a regular expression.

# search()
- The search() method of String values executes a search for a match between a regular expression and this string, returning the index of the first match in the string.

# replace()
- The replace() method of String values returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement.
