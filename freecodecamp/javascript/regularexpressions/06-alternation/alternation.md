# Alternation
- Alternation is yet another way you can specify a set of options. Here, you use the pipe character | to match any of several subexpressions. Either of the subexpressions is called an alternative.
- pipe means 'or'
- **?** for optional. For example: **/colou?r/g** identify u? matches zero or one "u".
