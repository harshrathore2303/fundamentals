# Local Storage
JavaScript localStorage is a feature that lets you store data in your browser using key-value pairs. The data stays saved even after you close the browser, so it can be used again when you open it later. This helps keep track of things like user preferences or state across different sessions.

# Operations with localStorage
- localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
- localStorage.getItem('key');
- localStorage.removeItem('key');
- localStorage.clear();
